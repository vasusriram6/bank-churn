This is a work in progress project.
Model Building is done and deployed the model using Flask. Yet to upload the model into Heroku server.
EDA can also be expanded upon

The project is done using the Anaconda environment.
Some extra packages were required to run the notebook and app.py files besides the ones already integrated within Anaconda:
-seaborn
-sklearn
-imblearn
-xgboost
-pickle
-flask

The app.py file doesn't require all the above libraries. Only sklearn, pickle and flask are required.
After running, the application will be hosted in a local IP address which will be visible in the editor terminal.
